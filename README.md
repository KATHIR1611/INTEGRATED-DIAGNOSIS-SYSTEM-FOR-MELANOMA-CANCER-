## Existing System:
Traditional melanoma detection relies on manual image analysis, which is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Existing systems may use machine learning but are limited in precision and can require extensive data preprocessing, lacking the robustness needed for real-world clinical use.

## Proposed System:
The Melanoma Prediction System introduces a CNN-based approach for skin lesion classification, enhancing accuracy in predicting malignant melanoma. By automating image feature extraction and classification, this system reduces the need for manual diagnostic procedures and improves speed and accuracy.

## Proposed Methodology:
- **Data Collection:** Dermoscopic images are uploaded by the user.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model accuracy.
- **Feature Extraction:** CNN layers automatically extract essential features from the images.
- **Classification:** The model predicts whether the skin lesion is benign or malignant.
- **Output Generation:** Results are displayed to the user with confidence scores.
